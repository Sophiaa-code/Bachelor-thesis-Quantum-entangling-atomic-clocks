# Bachelor thesis: Quantum entangling atomic clocks to enhance topological dark matter detection

My bachelor thesis was a theoretical project, utilising the quantum computing project. There was little coding to it, however I thought it would still be interesting to post my final thesis and especially a video explaining my research in simple terms. Enjoy!
